Branches, normally we have branches are master/main by default.
These branch will hold / contains the project code to deploy / redeploy.
To get to understand the branches, Let's take an example: Tree 
The Tree is having the branches, each branch has been settled seperately.
As like, Repository is having the branches, each branch holds code.
For example, We have 10 developers, each developer is using the common
 file to do work on specific funcationality/feature. Like File name:
 Family.txt. In these file one person wanted to add his personal details
 in that text file, another person also wanted to add her personal
 details in that file like wise 10 persons wants to add their personal
 details in that text file. So, for that ever person has to create their
 own branch to keep their details in that file. After doing their task
 they will raise a pull request in remote repository to the teamleader 
 for review and merging. If everything is fine, then team leader will 
 merge the code into their branch(which we say main branch).
To create a branch, we use command:
git checkout -b "Masthan".
Let's understand it now, here checkout is not but a jumping from one 
branch to another so, our current branch is "main". I used checkout
to jump from main to masthan origin. Here, in that command -b is used
for creating a branch, so i created a -b "Masthan". So, this branch holds
my code. Likewise, everone can create their own branches.
