GIT is a version control system, why we say like that. Assume, we created a project
and it is deployed into the market. Now, it became real world website. If it is a real world website, there should be a traffic(nothing but no of users using the same website at a time). Now, let me get into the topic. Take an example for real world website which is Facebook. It's a real world website where too many users using that software at a time. 
So, we take that project to add some new updates. Finally we added the updates. But, it is facing with bug. If there was a bug, software would be crash on user environment. If it got crashed, user traffic would become less. So, to fix this issue we go back to previous version.
 Assume updated version 1.1.15 so we go back to previous version which is 1.1.14. If incase, that older version removed from our local system, it would impact a lot. However, it will be impact in future. So for that, We need a remote repository(Repository means project folder) then remote is nothing but an internet. These are all for to save our project files on specific internet server. Now, we get the GIT HUB into this topic. Before that, need to know we have so many repositories which is availabe in the market those are BIT BUCKET, GIT HUB, GIT LAB etc. So, GIT HUB is one example of remote hosting service( Hosting is nothing but a holding or storing others project files) means suppose we store others project files or folders into our servers, then we become a remote repository GIT Hosting Sevice.
